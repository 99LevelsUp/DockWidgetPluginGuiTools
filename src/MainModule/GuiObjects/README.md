# GuiObjects

There are so many different GUI libraries that I desperately needed to create my own. The main purpose of this GUI library is to look as much similar to standard Roblox Studio GUIs as possible so plugins integrate seamlessly into studio docks.

Basic superclass of all the GUI objects is [GuiObject.md](GuiObject.md).
